This library contains a number of optimizations for fast bit scanning in 64 bit computers. It has been used succesfully to implement BBMC, a very fast maximum clique algorithm. BBMC encodes the adjacency matrix as as set of bitstrings and computes the main operations of the search as bit masks.

BBMC has been described in a number of papers. Below are the main references:

In [4], BBMC was rated fastest at present.
